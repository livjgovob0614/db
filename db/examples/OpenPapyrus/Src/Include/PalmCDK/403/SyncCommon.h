 * @defgroup SyncAPIVersioning Sync API Versioning
 * @par
 * (v2.0 and later)
 * @par
 * The SYNC MANAGER API VERSION scheme enables the conduits to identify the level
 * of service provided by the Sync Manager DLL.
 * @par
 * MAJOR AND MINOR VERSION NUMBERS:
 * @par
 * Beginning with the current version (v2.0), the Sync Manager API will strive to
 * maintain backward compatibility within a given MAJOR version number group.  As new
 * exported functions are added to the API or critical bugs are fixed, the MINOR version number of
 * the API will be incremented and the documentation of the new functions will identify the
 * API version number where they were first available.  The conduits can (and should) check
 * the Sync Manager API version number using the function SyncGetAPIVersion().
 * So, if a conduit requires a particular Sync Manager function
 * which was added in API version number 2.1, for example, the conduit should call SyncGetAPIVersion
 * to make sure that the MAJOR number is 2 and the MINOR number is 1 or greater.
 * @par
 * SYNC MANAGER DLL NAMING CONVENTION:
 * @par
 * The Sync Manager DLL will be named to reflect the MAJOR API version number.  For example, the release
 * version of the Sync Manager DLL which implements a 2.x API will be named Sync20.dll.  The debug
 * version of same will be named Sync20d.dll.  This convention permits a conduit which depends on given
 * MAJOR and MINOR Sync Manager API version numbers to link with a Sync Manager DLL which implements an
 * API with the same MAJOR version number but a higher MINOR version number.

/**
 *
 * This method calls a handheld application (executable) and returns 
 * data and status information to your conduit from that application.
 * This API is similar to SyncCallRemoteModule(), but allows the
 * target application to be uniquely identified by creator, name and
 * database type (classic, schema or extended).
 * @par
 * Note that almost all conduits can accomplish their tasks without needing to
 * use this function, which is provided as a "back door" function. PalmSource,
 * Inc. recommends not using this function unless absolutely essential.  
 * @par
 * You can use the parameter block to send arbitrary data to the
 * application. The application can store variable-sized information into the
 * parameter block, which you can examine when the call completes.  
 * @par
 * Note that the format of the data and the action codes are completely
 * application specific. The handheld application that you call must have the
 * same structure as a Palm OS application; however, the application
 * can have a proprietary type ID so that it does not show up in the
 * launcher.
 *
 * @param pParams			[in/out] An object of the CCallApplicationParams class, which contains information for the 
 *								called application, and returns information to you from the called application, in the following
 *                              fields:  
 * @param m_dbName          [in] A TCHAR pointer specifying the name of the target application
 * @param m_dwCreatorId		[in] A UInt32 value containing the creator ID of the target application. 
 * @param m_wAttributes     [in] A UInt16 combination of dmHdrAttr bits that specify whether the target app is a classic,
 *                              extended or schema database. All other dmHdrAttr bits are ignored.
 * @param m_dwTypeID		[in] A UInt32 value containing the type ID of the target application.  m_dwTypeID is used as a cross
 *                              check and may be set to zero for "don't care".
 * @param m_wActionCode		[in] A UInt16 value containing the action code selector. This value is specific to the 
 *								module that you are calling. 
 * @param m_dwParamSize		[in] A UInt32 value specifying the parameter block size. 
 * @param m_pParam			[in] A void pointer to the parameter block. 
 * @param m_dwResultBufSize [in] A UInt32 value specifying the size of the results buffer, in bytes. 
 * @param m_pResultBuf		[out] An array of bytes of length m_dwResultBufSize that receives the results of the method. The caller must
 *								allocate this buffer.
 * @param m_dwResultCode	[out] A UInt32 value that receives the result code returned by the handheld module. 
 * @param m_dwActResultSize [out] A UInt32 value that receives the actual data size returned by the handheld module. 

 *
 * @retval SInt32 The return value is a SInt32 value specifying success or error.
 * @retval 0 If successful, this method returns 0.
 * @retval <0 If unsuccessful, this method returns negative error code value.
 * @retval SYNCERR_COMM_NOT_INIT 
 * @retval SYNCERR_LOST_CONNECTION 
 * @retval SYNCERR_REMOTE_SYS 
 * @retval SYNCERR_REMOTE_MEM 
 * @retval SYNCERR_UNKNOWN_REQUEST is returned if the handheld module was not found, or if the 
 *				handheld module did not handle the action code. 
 * @retval SYNC_LOCAL_BUFF_TOO_SMALL is returned if your results buffer was not large enough to contain 
 *				the results data. If this is the case, then upon return the value of m_dwActResultSize 
 *				will be greater than the value of m_dwResultBufSize, and only m_dwResultBufSize bytes were 
 *				copied to the results buffer.

/*
 * Per-process replication structure.
 *
 * There are 2 mutexes used in the Base replication API.  (See LOCK_MUTEX in
 * repmgr.h for a discussion of repmgr.)
 * 1.  mtx_region - This protects the fields of the rep region above.
 * 2.  mtx_clientdb - This protects the per-process flags, and bookkeeping
 * database and all of the components that maintain it.  Those
 * components include the following fields in the log region (see log.h):
 *	a. ready_lsn
 *	b. waiting_lsn
 *	c. verify_lsn
 *	d. wait_recs
 *	e. rcvd_recs
 *	f. max_wait_lsn
 * These fields in the log region are NOT protected by the log region lock at
 * all.
 *
 * Note that the per-process flags should truly be protected by a special
 * per-process thread mutex, but it is currently set in so isolated a manner
 * that it didn't make sense to do so and in most case we're already holding
 * the mtx_clientdb anyway.
 *
 * The lock ordering protocol is that mtx_clientdb must be acquired first and
 * then either REP->mtx_region, or the LOG->mtx_region mutex may be acquired if
 * necessary.
 *
 * Note that the appropriate mutex is needed any time one or more related
 * values are read or written that could possibly use more than one atomic
 * machine instruction.  A single 32-bit integer value is safe without a
 * mutex, but most other types of value should use a mutex.
 *
 * Any use of a mutex must be inside a matched pair of ENV_ENTER() and
 * ENV_LEAVE() macros.  This ensures that if a thread dies while holding
 * a lock (i.e. a mutex), recovery can clean it up so that it does not
 * indefinitely block other threads.

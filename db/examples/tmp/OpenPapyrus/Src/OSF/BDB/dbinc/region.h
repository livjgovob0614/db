/*
 * The DB environment consists of some number of "regions", which are described
 * by the following four structures:
 *
 *	REGENV	   -- shared information about the environment
 *	REGENV_REF -- file describing system memory version of REGENV
 *	REGION	   -- shared information about a single region
 *	REGINFO	   -- per-process information about a REGION
 *
 * There are three types of memory that hold regions:
 *	per-process heap (SAlloc::M)
 *	file mapped into memory (mmap, MapViewOfFile)
 *	system memory (shmget, CreateFileMapping)
 *
 * By default, regions are created in filesystem-backed shared memory.  They
 * can also be created in system shared memory (DB_SYSTEM_MEM), or, if private
 * to a process, in heap memory (DB_PRIVATE).
 *
 * Regions in the filesystem are named "__db.001", "__db.002" and so on.  If
 * we're not using a private environment allocated in heap, "__db.001" will
 * always exist, as we use it to synchronize on the regions, whether they are
 * in filesystem-backed memory or system memory.
 *
 * The file "__db.001" contains a REGENV structure pointing to  an
 * array of REGION structures.  Each REGION structures describes an
 * underlying chunk of shared memory.

 *
 * The tricky part about manipulating the regions is creating or joining the
 * database environment.  We have to be sure only a single thread of control
 * creates and/or recovers a database environment.  All other threads should
 * then join without seeing inconsistent data.
 *
 * We do this in two parts: first, we use the underlying O_EXCL flag to the
 * open system call to serialize creation of the __db.001 file.  The thread
 * of control creating that file then proceeds to create the remaining
 * regions in the environment, including the mutex region.  Once the mutex
 * region has been created, the creating thread of control fills in the
 * __db.001 file's magic number.  Other threads of control (the ones that
 * didn't create the __db.001 file), wait on the initialization of the
 * __db.001 file's magic number.  After it has been initialized, all threads
 * of control can proceed, using normal shared mutex locking procedures for
 * exclusion.
 *
 * REGIONs are not moved or removed during the life of the environment, and
 * so processes can have long-lived references to them.
 *
 * One of the REGION structures describes the environment region itself.
 *
 * The REGION array is not locked in any way.  It's an array so we don't have
 * to manipulate data structures after a crash -- on some systems, we have to
 * join and clean up the mutex region after application failure.  Using an
 * array means we don't have to worry about broken links or other nastiness
 * after the failure.
 *
 * All requests to create or join a region return a REGINFO structure, which
 * is held by the caller and used to open and subsequently close the reference
 * to the region.  The REGINFO structure contains the per-process information
 * that we need to access the region.
 *
 * The one remaining complication.  If the regions (including the environment
 * region) live in system memory, and the system memory isn't "named" somehow
 * in the filesystem name space, we need some way of finding it.  Do this by
 * by writing the REGENV_REF structure into the "__db.001" file.  When we find
 * a __db.001 file that is too small to be a real, on-disk environment, we use
 * the information it contains to redirect to the real "__db.001" file/memory.
 * This currently only happens when the REGENV file is in shared system memory.
 *
 * Although DB does not currently grow regions when they run out of memory, it
 * would be possible to do so.  To grow a region, allocate a new region of the
 * appropriate size, then copy the old region over it and insert the additional
 * memory into the already existing shalloc arena.  Region users must reset
 * their base addresses and any local pointers into the memory, of course.
 * This failed in historic versions of DB because the region mutexes lived in
 * the mapped memory, and when it was unmapped and remapped (or copied),
 * threads could lose track of it.  Also, some systems didn't support mutex
 * copying, e.g., from OSF1 V4.0:
 *
 *	The address of an msemaphore structure may be significant.  If the
 *	msemaphore structure contains any value copied from an msemaphore
 *	structure at a different address, the result is undefined.
 *
 * All mutexes are now maintained in a separate region which is never unmapped,
 * so growing regions should be possible.

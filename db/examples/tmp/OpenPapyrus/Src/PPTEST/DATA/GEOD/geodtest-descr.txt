Each line of the test set gives 10 space delimited numbers

    latitude at point 1, lat1 (degrees, exact)
    longitude at point 1, lon1 (degrees, always 0)
    azimuth at point 1, azi1 (clockwise from north in degrees, exact)
    latitude at point 2, lat2 (degrees, accurate to 10−18 deg)
    longitude at point 2, lon2 (degrees, accurate to 10−18 deg)
    azimuth at point 2, azi2 (degrees, accurate to 10−18 deg)
    geodesic distance from point 1 to point 2, s12 (meters, exact)
    arc distance on the auxiliary sphere, a12 (degrees, accurate to 10−18 deg)
    reduced length of the geodesic, m12 (meters, accurate to 0.1 pm)
    the area under the geodesic, S12 (m2, accurate to 1 mm2)

These are computed using as direct geodesic calculations with the given lat1, lon1, azi1, and s12. The distance s12 always corresponds to 
an arc length a12 ≤ 180°, so the given geodesics give the shortest paths from point 1 to point 2. For simplicity and without loss of generality, 
lat1 is chosen in [0°, 90°], lon1 is taken to be zero, azi1 is chosen in [0°, 180°]. Furthermore, lat1 and azi1 are taken to be multiples 
of 10−12 deg and s12 is a multiple of 0.1 μm in [0 m, 20003931.4586254 m]. This results in lon2 in [0°, 180°] and azi2 in [0°, 180°].

/**
Login page: user must fill form with his credentials.
Authentication works properly only if 
it.eng.spagobi.services.security.service.ISecurityServiceSupplier.checkAuthentication(String userId, String psw) 
method is implemented, therefore it should work if knowage is installed as a web application.
If Knowage is installed into a portal environment, the above method should be implemented for the portal in use (eXo, Liferay, ...).
The form points to documentsList.jsp.
